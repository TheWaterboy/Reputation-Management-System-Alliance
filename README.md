Productivity is one of the major challenge of our time, how to gain productivity for the public/private sector is the key for a vibrant 
economy to improve our living quality standard.Sadly america did not enjoy labor force productivity growth above 2% for a long time, 
this current productivity stagnation should be taking seriously as a serious treat to our economic freedom. The net result of this 
productivity stagnation is rising wage inequality and that could put the americain economy into perpetuel stagflation states,
that no good news.
