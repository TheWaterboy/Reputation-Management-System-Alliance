Reputation Management System Alliance (RMSA) is a open collaborative consortium focused on reputation system trough standardization and 
tokenization.

Productivity is one of the major challenge of our time, how to gain productivity for the public/private sector is the key for a vibrant economy to improve our living quality standard.Sadly america did not enjoy labor force productivity growth above 2% for a long time (almost a decade), this current productivity stagnation should be taking seriously as a serious treat to our economic freedom. The net result of this productivity stagnation is rising wage inequality and that could put the americain economy into perpetuel stagflation states,that no good news.                                                                                                               

The trust factor is very important, nowadays trust is near a all time low toward the public/private sector, we do beleive that we can change that for the better, trough clarity and accountablity with the use of news technology that improve reflexiveness inside a decentralised/distributed paradigm.

# Why Using A Consortium Model                                                                                                                        
The need for reputation management system reside inside every industry, is no trivial task to build universal accepted standard for disparate industry stakeholders.By pooling ressource, we will be able to takle many problem for capital access, labor skill shortage, interoperability and standardization.Our best shot for the consortium structure is a "Hub and Spoke" model with each partners becoming formal members of the consortium inside specified working group related to their field.

# (RMSA) Objective "The Trifecta"
Reputation system are subjective, the reputation logic could only be inductive, what define the objectivity is the output.The three key for reputation management system objectivity is trust, productivity and quality control, trust is the summation function of the reputation system virtuous loop. Basically to improve productivity we need go from the punching card "punch in", "punch out" to the scoring card "score in", "score out", with a clear set of parameter to analyse data set inside a predetermided states machine with replication and duplication for business logic states distributions to all stakeholders.  

# Open Solution 
We could not build token standardization for reputation system inside closed loop, the risk to waste rescourse without purposeful activity is running way to high to be a considered avenue,the energy cost of managing compexity have to be keep in check. With open solution we could boost more then one ecosystem providing end user choice for technology service provider and improve data set parameter curation for end user.

# Modealization
Modealization is a new lexique to describe the blockchain stack in more simple term, by the fact we have, consensus, incentivization mechanism and different data structure that involve inside a event driven microservice architecure with programmed tx_instruction set that increase complexity.  We need a new simple definition that is fair and quare versus the old on/off states blockchain definition commonly employed that suffer from intellectual emptiness. 

"Modealization" that sound great for capturing the true essence of the internet of value, repeat [mo][deal][ization].
[mo]--> blockchain/DLTs model, {private/permissioned/consortium}, {public/permissionless}, or hybrid {private/public},
[deal]--> incentivization mechanism for consensus participation, e.g block reward for Bitcoin
[ization]--> is a reference to globalization; trade and transactions, capital and investment movements, {6 degree of separation and technology evolution for AI, VR, quantum computing, IoT etc...} and the dissemination of knowledge. 

Autonomous agents aggregator as two states for business logic, [intra-modealization] which is the self reference business logic reflexive with is consensus, on public blockchain is hard coded inside the base layer ,[extra-modealization] is the logic that refer to states channel that interact with oracle, block reward function could be interchanged between intra/extra modealization depending of the stakeholders architectures of choice.
