Reputation Management System Alliance (RMSA) is a open collaborative consortium focused on reputation system trough standardization and 
tokenization.                                                                                                                              
# 99 Problems                                                                                                                                 
Productivity is one of the major challenge of our time, how to gain productivity for the public/private sector is the key for a vibrant economy to improve our living quality standard.Sadly america did not enjoy labor force productivity growth above 2% for a long time (almost a decade), this current productivity stagnation should be taking seriously as a serious treat to our economic freedom. The net result of this productivity stagnation is rising wage inequality and that could put the americain economy into perpetuel stagflation states,that no good news.                                                                                                                
The trust factor is very important, nowadays trust is near a all time low toward the public/private sector, we do beleive that we can change that for the better, trough clarity and accountablity with the use of news technology that improve reflexiveness inside a decentralised/distributed paradigm.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
# Why Using A Consortium Model                                                                                                                        
The need for reputation management system reside inside every industry, is no trivial task to build universal accepted standard for disparate industry stakeholders.By pooling ressource, we will be able to takle many problem for capital access, labor skill shortage, interoperability and standardization.Our best shot for the consortium structure is a "Hub and Spoke" model with each partners becoming formal members of the consortium inside specified working group related to their field.

# (RMSA) Objective "The Trifecta"
Reputation system are subjective, the reputation logic could only be inductive, what define the objectivity is the output.The three key for reputation management system objectivity is trust, productivity and quality control, trust is the summation function of the reputation system virtuous loop. Basically to improve productivity we need go to the punching card "punch in", "punch out" to the scoring card "score in", "score out", with a clear set of parameter to analyse data set inside a predetermided states machine with replication and duplication for business logic states distributions to all stakeholders.  

# Open Solution 
We could not build token standardization for reputation system inside closed loop, the risk to waste rescourse without purposeful activity is running way to high to be a considered avenue. With open solution we could boost more then one ecosystem providing end user choice for technology service provider and improve data parameter curation for end user.
