Productivity is one of the major challenge of our time, how to gain productivity for the public/private sector is the key for a vibrant economy to improve our living quality standard.Sadly america did not enjoy labor force productivity growth above 2% for a long time (almost a decade), this current productivity stagnation should be taking seriously as a serious treat to our economic freedom. The net result of this productivity stagnation is rising wage inequality and that could put the americain economy into perpetuel stagflation states,that no good news.
The trust factor is very important, nowadays trust is near a all time low toward the public/private sector, we do beleive that we can change that for the better, trough clairty and accountablity with the use of news technology that is user centric inside a decentralised/distributed paradigm.
